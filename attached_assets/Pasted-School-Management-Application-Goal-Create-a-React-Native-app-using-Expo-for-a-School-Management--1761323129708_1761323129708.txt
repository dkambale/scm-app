School Management Application

Goal: Create a React Native app using Expo for a School Management System.
The app should have authentication, authorization (roles and permissions), and CRUD operations for multiple entities.
There will be three user personas: Admin, Teacher, and Student.

⚙️ Tech Stack

Frontend: React Native with Expo SDK (latest)

Navigation: React Navigation v7 (stack + tab + drawer where needed)

State Management: Context API or Redux Toolkit

API Calls: Axios with interceptor for JWT token

Storage: SecureStore or AsyncStorage for token persistence

UI Framework: React Native Paper / Native Base (clean & minimal look)

Form Handling: Formik + Yup

Authorization: Role-based access control (RBAC) — restrict screens & actions

Backend (dummy / mock initially): JSON-server or mock API with roles, permissions, and CRUD

Authentication: JWT-based login/logout

Authorization middleware: Use role and permission mapping
